How to get involved
===================

We strive to be developer friendly. We've included a lot of comments in the code
itself to help developers understand the core APIs and inner-workings of the
Commerce systems. We're continuing to flesh out the Developer Guide here on
DrupalCommerce.org, and we encourage developers to file bug reports in the issue
tracker and find support in IRC (#drupal-commerce on irc.freenode.net) where we
try to be very responsive.
